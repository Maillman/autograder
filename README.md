## Development
### Running the database
There is a docker compose file in the root of the project that will start a MySQL database. To start the database, run the following command (you will need docker installed):
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Alternatively, you can run the database locally with your own MySQL server. Be sure to update `src/main/resources/db.properties` with the correct database url, username, and password.

## Websocket Commands

1. Client connects via /ws
2. Client sends a message with the following format:
    ```json
    {
      "repoUrl": "https://github.com/cosmo/chess.git",
      "phase": 3
    }
    ```
3. Server responds with a message with the following format:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "queueStatus",
      "position": 3,
      "total": 4
    }
   ```
4. When the position in the queue changes, new `queueStatus` messages are sent
5. When the client's submission starts to be processed, the server sends a `started` message:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "started"
    }
    ```
6. As the autograder runs, the server sends `update` messages:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "update",
      "message": "Step x is starting"
    }
    ```
7. When the autograder is done, the server sends a `results` message, containing the results of the autograder:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "results",
      "results": "{...}"
    }
    ```
8. If an error occurs, the server sends an `error` message:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "error",
      "message": "Something went wrong"
    }
    ```
