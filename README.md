```

## Deployment
Before running the server, two configuration files need to be modified to match your environment:
1. `src/main/resources/config.properties` - contains the frontend and backend urls
2. `src/main/resources/frontend/.env.prod` - contains the url of the backend

### Docker
For a docker deployment, run one of the following commands:
```bash
# For a deployment with a MySQL database included
docker compose --profile with-db up -d
```
```bash
# For a deployment requiring an external MySQL database
docker compose up -d
```

Note, if you are using the docker MySQL database, ensure that in `src/main/resources/db.properties` the property `db.url` is set to `db:3306`

## Development
### Pre-requisites
#### Node/Yarn
The frontend is built using Vue.js. To run the frontend, you will need to have `yarn`.
After installing `Node`, run the following to enable `yarn` globally:
```bash
corepack enable
```
(`sudo` may be required)

#### Backend
The backend of the app can be run with either `maven`, or by running your own MySQL server.

##### Maven
Go fishüêü These instructions are not included in this file.

#### Database

You can run the database inside a Docker container, or locally with your own MySQL server.

##### Docker
Run the following in the root of the project to start the db container:
```bash
docker compose up db -d
```

##### MySQL
Go fishüêü These instructions are not included in this file.

### Getting Started
NOTE: These instructions will help you set up this project in Intelli-J.
If there are any holes or gaps in the instructions, please submit a new pull request
to share the learned knowledge with the people behind you.
1. Clone the repo onto your local machine.
2. Ensure that you are using the latest version of JVM. The system currently requires version 21+.
3. Use `yarn` to install all dependencies. This must be done from the _front end_ root folder.
    ```bash
    cd src/main/resources/frontend
    yarn
    ```
4. Setup "Server" _Run Configuration_
   - Navigate to the server file: `src/main/java/edu/byu/cs/server/Server.java`
   - Click the "Run" button to run `Server.main()`
   - This will give you a _Run Configuration_ that you can modify in the following steps.
5. Set up [environment variables](#environment-variables)
   - Reference the [subtitle below](#environment-variables) for the list of required variables
   - Prepare the values you will use for each variable
      - Put them all onto a single line, with each variable separated by a `;` (semicolon)
   - Edit the "Server" run configuration
      - Paste in the single line of parameters to the line titled "Environment Variables"
      - Going forward, there is an option to open up a table of the variables where you can
        edit just one value from the lot
   - Save & apply the changes
6. [Enable logging](#enabling-logging) by following the instructions below
7. **Change config properties**
   - Navigate to the following file: `src/main/resources/config.properties`
   - For a simple development setup, skip now to the subheading [Dev Config Properties](#environment-variables-for-development)
   - Change the value of the following three properties:
     - `frontend_app.url`
     - `backend_app.url`
     - `backend_app.cas_callback_url`
8. **Run the Autograder Locally**
   - Run your "Server" run configuration
   - Run the frontend by referencing the [section below](#running-locally)
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

#### Environment Variables
For both deployment and development, the following environment variables are required to be set.
```
DB_URL=<host>:<port>
DB_USER=<user>
DB_PASSWORD=<password>
DB_NAME=autograder
CANVAS_AUTHORIZATION_KEY=<canvas api key>
```

##### Environment Variables For Development
Here are values typically used for development:
* DB_URL=localhost:3306
* DB_NAME=autograder

While you can use any root user credentials to access the MySQL database, you may be interested in creating
a special login for this project with restricted privileges. That decision is left to you.

A Canvas Authorization Key is required to run the project. The Autograder currently relies on information from Canvas
to give you admin access to the app (see [#164](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/autograder/issues/164)).
Generating a Canvas API Key is easy and straight forward:
1. Login to [Canvas](https://byu.instructure.com/)
2. Visit your [Profile Settings](https://byu.instructure.com/profile/settings)
   - Navigate here manually as "Account > Settings"
3. Scroll down to the **Approved Integrations** section
4. Click "+ New Access Token"
5. Provide the requested information in the modal box
6. Copy the generated access token
7. Use it as the value of the `CANVAS_AUTHORIZATION` environment variable above

#### Enabling Logging

To enable logging, add arguments `-Dlog4j2.configurationFile=log4j.properties -Dlog4j2.debug=false` as vm options.

In IntelliJ, Go into the run configuration you want to use -> `Modify Options` -> `Add VM options`. This will reveal an additional box inside of the edit menu. Paste the arguments into the box.

If running from the command line, add the arguments immediately after the `java` command.

#### Change Config Properties
This code snippet contains the values you will likely want to use for development.
Notice that all the urls are referencing `localhost`, but the ports have been filled in with the default values.

**NEVER COMMIT THESE CHANGES TO THE REPO.** Even though you are changing them for local development, the current
values should remain in the codebase. Take care when committing to exclude these files.

Locate the variables, and replace them with this snippet (currently, they are located at the end of the file):
```properties
# The URL of the frontend application
frontend_app.url=http://localhost:5173

# The URL of the backend application
backend_app.url=http://localhost:8080

backend_app.cas_callback_url=http://localhost:8080/auth/callback
```

#### Running Locally
The frontend can be easily deployed by navigating to the correct directory, and calling an init script.

```bash
cd src/main/resources/frontend
yarn dev
```
